# The Krov Engine

## What is this?
The Krov Engine is a GPU-accelerated raytracing engine made in C++ with love by Saalty, a friend of mine. His github account is @waternine9\. All credit goes to him.

## What does it do?
The Krov Engine can support:
- Real-time rendering
- Raytracing
- Soft & hard shadows
- `.obj` file support
- Simple physics
- Dynamic cameras with collision detection

## What does it require?
The Krov Engine requires 3 libraries pre-installed
- GLM
- OpenCV
- CUDA

## How do I install it?
Simple (kind of)! Just create a C++ CUDA project, preferably using Visual Studio 2019, add the files and folders in this github repo to the project, and install the libraries mentioned above!

This is Saalty's hobby, and along with AI, this is his favorite topic of computer science. I may pitch in occasionally, but most of this work is completely his. Hope you have fun with it!
